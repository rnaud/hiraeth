# The References: notes per world

The References level (`?level=references`) rebuilds every reference sheet's panels as views
(README "The References"). The README sections on the desert, the City-Shaft and Vael II are on
main; the notes for the worlds after them, and the shader work they brought, are here.

## Spot blacks: a third tier of value (post.js `uSpot`, `uSpotTone`)

The sheets shade in three values, not two: the lit colour, the shadow (about ×0.55–0.7 of it) and
spot blacks, near-black masses (dark brown, olive or indigo, never pure black) with a hard edge,
filling the enclosed pockets: between ribs and pipes, into a hull or a machine's interior, the
recesses of the hanging city, and the cast shadow of a big mass (IMG_3774, IMG_3789–3792). Ours
stopped at the shadow tint (lifted further by the half-tone and the flat print); `uCrevice` only inks
the narrowest creases.

- **How enclosed** (`enclosure()` in post.js): from the G-buffer's depth and normals, the share of
  neighbours a pocket's radius away (`uSpot.y`, m) that stand in front of the point's face, from 8
  fixed directions (4 on the handheld preset, `uPostLite`). No jitter: the estimate is smooth from
  pixel to pixel, so a hard threshold of it (`uSpot.z`) is a clean-edged mass, not a speckle.
- **Where**: only in shade (`lit < 0.5`), less where the shade is lifted (half-tone, bounce, a
  material's `shade`), fading out by 600 m; never on a face, a person, the traveller, grass, a light
  or glass. A point facing the sun but in shade is in a cast shadow: it darkens toward the spot
  tone by `uSpot.w` (the world's knob for how dark big cast masses go), keeping its strokes.
- **The tone** (`uSpotTone`): rgb, and a how much of the surface's own colour it keeps (rust stays a
  dark rust, teal a dark teal).
- **Per world**: the presets (all of them say it; Moebius print `[1, 3, 0.3, 0.2]`), a world's
  `defaults.look` and a view's `look`. The Buried Machine `BURIED_SPOTS` (`[1, 3.5, 0.27, 0.45]`, a
  rust-brown tone keeping more of each colour); IMG_3774's views `INK_SHADOWS` (cast shadows 0.75).
- **Per material** (`makeMaterial({ spot })`, `SPOT`): packed over the drawn detail in `gHatch.b`
  (+4 × (1 + step); the detail stays under 2); a self-lit or glass surface says 0, so do the
  references' clouds. Unsaid: the world's.
- **Debug**: `params.debug` 9 shows how enclosed each pixel is, 10 the cast (red) and spot (green)
  masks.
- **Cost** (M4 Pro, 1280 × 720, frames back to back, the tier off and on interleaved in the same
  page, 40 pairs): High desert 7.25 / 7.18 and 6.9 / 7.0 ms, Buried 12.8 / 12.7 and 7.1 / 7.3,
  City-Shaft 12.7 / 12.8 and 8.9 / 8.4, Vael II 9.7 / 11.4 and 8.4 / 8.5; Handheld desert 5.6 / 5.5,
  Buried 3.9 / 4.1 and 3.3 / 3.4, City-Shaft 7.0 / 6.9, Vael II 3.8 / 3.9. Within the run-to-run
  spread except Vael II's spawn on High (+1.7 ms, its many shaded overhangs pay the taps): the taps
  are only paid by shaded pixels within 600 m. No new GLSL features (WebView 109).
- `tests/shade.test.js`: every preset sets it, the packing, the shader's exclusions and the handheld
  taps.

## The Buried Machine (IMG_3789–3792)

- **The views** (`src/levels/reference-buried.js`, `BURIED_VIEWS`): IMG_3789 (5 panels), IMG_3790
  (6), IMG_3791 (6), IMG_3792 (5), views 82–103 after Vael II's. One scene builder (`machineScene`):
  domed huts half sunk in the dunes, pipe elbows with flanges, banks of pipes in a trench, walls
  pierced by ovals (an oval reaching the floor cut as a doorway), tanks, machinery against a wall,
  the teal drum open to the sky, the hanging city, the ring of arches with its town, derricks and
  hanging capsules, the sea of cloud (`cloudSea` from reference-vael2.js). The look `BURIED_LOOK`:
  shade the surface's own colour darkened (no flat print), a clean sky, the world's spot blacks.
- **On the world** (`buried.js`): `BURIED_SPOTS` in its `defaults.look` (the deep machinery and the
  canyon's cast shadows darker, a rust-brown spot tone); `?look=buried` draws the views in it.
- **Left, shader level**: the sheets' interiors are a dense mass of small inked machinery (pipes,
  boxes, hatches) at every scale; the spot blacks fill our pockets but our scenes have few of them,
  so most views show big plain faces where the sheets show texture. The sheets' clouds are soft
  cream masses with a few thin lines (ours are inked lumps, as Vael II). The hanging city's
  recesses are mostly lit on the sheets; ours shade as one mass. The canyon floor's dense
  stippling and the dunes' long shaded slopes (IMG_3790 p5: a slope in shade a flat sage band)
  aren't drawn.
- **Left, scene level**: the trench's pipe mass (IMG_3789 p1), the city's towers hanging in
  clusters, the drum's interior machinery and arcades, the oval tunnel's interior (IMG_3791 p4),
  the cave with the moon (IMG_3792 p3), the rock ledge of IMG_3792 p5 are all sketches.
