# The fluid blade and the foes (v0.89)

The first things in the game that fight back, and the tool's answer to them.

## The fluid blade (`src/fluid-blade.js`)

- **Input:** F, LB / L1, touch ⚔ (`toolInput().blade`; `PadBlade` in `src/controller.js`). It comes with the
  backpack: no item, no box. It costs no charge. On a pad, LB held with the right stick still zooms.
- **The combo:** a press swings (the first cut takes 0.62 s); a press during a swing or within `BLADE.chain` after it
  chains the next, up to three: right to left, left to right, then a heavier overhead (`BLADE.damage` 1, 1, 2),
  then `BLADE.cooldown`.
- **The swings:** `SWINGS` retains anticipation through follow-through from three Mixamo clips.
  `attackSample` maps separate wind/active/recover durations (0.22/0.16/0.24 s for the first,
  0.25/0.17/0.26 for the second, 0.36/0.20/0.34 for the heavy third) onto source time.
  Grounded swings use the legs and hips; airborne cuts use the upper body. `Animator.playCombat`
  blends clip changes over 90 ms from the displayed pose, including motion matching when enabled.
  Grounded cuts step forward through Player's normal collision movement and limit steering until recovery.
- **The arm (the arcs):** the swing drives the tool's aim pose (`player.aim`, the same IK the shots use) along
  `swingArc(n, u)`, so the body turns to the swing. It turns toward the nearest target with `lock: true` within
  `BLADE.lock` (6 m), else where you face.
- **Guard:** B / RB / R1 / touch ◇ independently raises the fluid shield. A fresh guard has a
  0.18 s parry window (0.35 s rearm), consumes that opportunity on contact, and spends no charge.
  A held guard spends one charge per block. Both require facing the blow. A parry leaves the enemy
  open for 1.8× its normal recovery; an ordinary block for 0.65×. Guard cannot cancel an active cut.
- **Evade:** Z / X / □ / touch ↶ moves in the input direction, or backward without input, for
  0.28 s with a 0.65 s cooldown. It uses Player's collision controller, has no invulnerability, and
  may cancel attack recovery but not wind-up or release. It is available on the ground.
  Controller push is now LT + RB; calling a mount is LT + X (Xbox positions).
- **The flinch:** a strike that lands without knocking you down plays the pack's impact on the upper body
  (`Player.flinch`, `FLINCH`).
- **What it hits:** during the active cut, coarse cone/range and wall checks find candidates, then
  a swept segment from the glove to the blade tip checks contact with target volumes. Each target
  is hit once per swing. Without a loaded character clip, the original cone is the fallback.
  Wildlife scatters once per swing; other non-blade targets do not take damage.
- **The look:** a capsule of the glob's lava material from the glove along the arm (shoulder to hand, leaning
  into the swing), a pale glowing edge, and glowing drops off it as a trail. It lights for the swing and fades.
  (The game's materials draw into the G-buffer: no transparency, so the glow is the bloom's.)

## The foes (`src/foes.js`)

`FOES` holds the tuning. Each foe is a `Foe` (pure logic over plain vectors, tested in node) drawn by `Foes`,
which also registers its target (`kind: 'foe', lock: true, accepts: ['blade', 'stun', 'fire']`).

- **The mind:** idle → chase → wind → strike → recover. Blots coil for 0.65 s, then lunge over
  0.24 s; machines plant and raise their arms for 1.05 s, then slam over 0.32 s. Direction locks
  when the wind-up begins. Damage occurs 55% through the strike, with a wall check. Movement
  checks footing and walls. Normal melee has no floor marker; body poses and sound are the tell.
  Boss area telegraphs and offscreen warnings remain. Light hits interrupt blots and the first
  two thirds of a machine's wind-up; the machine's late wind-up and strike commit.
- **What hurts them:**
  - the blade: `info.damage`;
  - a fluid or ember glob: washes a blot (1), only staggers a machine;
  - stilling: holds either for 3.5 s;
  - the push: shoves them.

  A cut breaks a blot's wind-up, and a machine's in its first two thirds.
- **What they do to you:** `strikeDamage` (as the guardians): a hit never takes a healthy bar below
  `HIT.floor`. A blot shoves you; a machine knocks you down.
- **The reward:** each foe cut down gives the tank a charge back (glowing drops fly to the flask).
- **Ink blots, in the wilds:**
  - `wild(p)` is this far from every person (placed and spawned, `WILD.people` 45 m) and from the ship's
    landing (`WILD.spawn` 55 m), not in the temple, not on `level.unsafe` ground, not riding or swimming.
  - After `PACK.settle` s out there, a pack of 2–3 comes in 18–26 m round you (the first ever is one, with a
    notice).
  - After a pack, a rest of 35–55 s. A pack left behind past 85 m dissolves.
- **The makers' machines, in the temples:**
  - one by each checkpoint stone past the first (`rt.marks`), none within 14 m of the guardian's arena;
  - placed where there is footing and nothing between it and the stone;
  - they stir only while you are inside the temple;
  - broken, they stay broken (flag `foes.<world>.m<i>`).
- **Off:** the Enemies setting (`settings.enemies`). Home, the Lab, the References and the Atelier
  (`PEACEFUL`) never have any.

## Feel (`src/feel.js`)

- **Hit-stop:** `hitStop(s)` slows the world's time step to `FEEL.slow` of real time (main.js `feelDt`):
  0.045 s on a light cut, 0.085 s on a heavy cut or parry, 0.04 s on an ordinary block.
- **Camera kick:** `kick(k)` jolts the camera after the rig places it (`shakeCamera`), settling over
  `FEEL.settle`; a foe's hit kicks harder (main.js `onHurt`).
- **Knockback:** the heavy third swing throws a foe 2.2× as far.
- **Turns:** `TURNS.strikers` (2) may wind up at once (`env.mayStrike`); the others circle at a step past
  their reach. `keepApart()` pushes foes standing inside each other apart.
- **Warnings:** a foe winding up off the screen (or behind the camera) shows a round marker at the screen's
  edge on its side, filling as its strike comes (`#foe-warn`, `Foes.warnings`).

## Ink and the blade's growth (`src/ink.js`)

The blots are the drawing's unfinished margins, gathered thickest where the singing light passed. Cut down,
a foe leaves ink (`INK_OF`: a blot 1, a machine 3) that runs into the glove (flag `ink`, never down). At
`UPGRADES` steps the blade grows, each said once:
- **reach** (8): the blade 1.3× as long, its swing as far (`REACH_UP`);
- **whirl** (20): the third swing is the Great Sword pack's high spin (`WHIRL`), cutting all round (half-angle
  π), damage 2;
- **lunge** (40): a swing begun at a run (not chained) is the pack's slide attack (`LUNGE`), carrying you
  into the cut, reach 3.6 m, damage 2.

The count is said every 5 ink.

## Placed encounters

- **Relic guards:** a relic out in the wilds (`content.relics.spots`, where `wild()` holds) gets `GUARDS.size`
  blots round it as you come within `GUARDS.near` (32 m).
- Cut down, they are gone for good (flag `foes.<world>.r<i>`).

## The Arena (`src/levels/arena.js`, `?level=arena`)

A developer's world in the worlds list: the desert's golden sand under an open sky (flat out to 150 m), standing stones, a ledge. `level.foes.waves` makes
`Foes` send `WAVES` round you, whatever the setting: one blot, three blots, a machine, two machines and two
blots, round and round, `WAVE.rest` s after the last one falls.

## Tests

`tests/foes.test.js`:
- the mind, the telegraph and stepping out of it;
- the damage table;
- the wilds and the packs;
- the floor on a hit;
- the machines staying broken;
- the blade's arcs, its soft lock, and that only blade targets feel it.

## Left to do

- The machine's model is a first pass of boxes.
- The packs hold more (deaths, kicks, the great sword's spins and jump attacks): a charged spin could come
  from them.
- Foes use procedural body animation rather than skeletal clips; machines still use the box model.
- No foe yet uses the temple kit (gusts, updrafts) or the open world's height.

## Combat checks (v0.89)

`tests/combat.test.js` checks commitment, timed block/rearm, swept contact, independent inputs,
full-body playback and transitions on the actual traveller with matching off and on, and evade movement.
Locomotion matching remains experimental and off by default: see animation.md for measured foot slide.
