# Moebius / Sable — three.js shader PoC

**Play it:** https://rnaud.github.io/moebius/

A small third-person desert exploration prototype. The point of it is the
rendering: a "ligne claire" look in the style of Moebius and the game *Sable*.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173
```

Controls: click to capture the mouse · WASD move · Shift run · Space jump ·
hold Space in the air to glide · mouse wheel zoom · Esc releases the mouse.
**E** interacts: whistle for the level's mount (or hail a taxi), get on, get
off. **L** opens the level picker. Each level's controls are listed below.

## Collision

`src/physics.js` bakes every static mesh of the level into one world-space
geometry with a [three-mesh-bvh](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh)
BVH. Moving things, plants and the desert heightfield are flagged
`userData.noCollide`; the heightfield keeps its own exact lookup.
- **Characters:**
  - a downward ground ray lets you step onto anything lower than 0.6 m and
    stand on rocks, mesa tops, roofs and domes;
  - a capsule from step height to the head is pushed out of walls and
    ceilings, and you slide along walls.
- **Bike and taxis** use the same rays and capsules.
- **Camera:** a line-of-sight ray pulls it in front of walls, so it never
  clips inside buildings.
The panel on the right exposes every shader parameter. It also has style
presets (Moebius / Sable / Animated ink) and debug views of each G-buffer channel.

## Levels

Opening the page with no `?level=` shows a **level picker**. Press **L** to
reopen it at any time, or **1–6** while it's open. Each level is a module in
`src/levels/`, registered in `src/levels/index.js`.

| # | Level | After | Getting around |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The Desert** (`desert`) | *Sable* (Shedworks) | walk, climb, glide, hoverbike |
| 2 | **The City-Shaft** (`incal`) | *L'Incal* (Jodorowsky & Moebius) | jetpack, climb, flying taxis |
| 3 | **Arzach** (`arzach`) | *Arzach* (Moebius) | the flying bird, climb |
| 4 | **The Airtight Garage** (`garage`) | *Le Garage hermétique* (Moebius) | portals, shifting gravity, jetpack |
| 5 | **Edena** (`edena`) | *Le Monde d'Edena* (Moebius) | climbing with stamina |
| 6 | **Perdide** (`perdide`) | *Les Maîtres du temps* (Laloux & Moebius) | hover-skiff, wading, caves |

- **The Desert:**
  - dunes, mesas, giant skeletons and monolith rings;
  - three regions: golden dunes, rose canyons and salt flats;
  - wind-blown sand and cloud shadows;
  - **E** whistles for the hoverbike.
- **The City-Shaft:**
  - a 520 m-wide pit, 580 m deep, with eight levels of terraces;
  - a central spire with rings, bridges and a golden palace on top;
  - flying taxis, landing pads, cables and an acid lake at the bottom;
  - **jetpack:** hold Space in the air; you get about 5 s of fuel;
  - **E** hails a taxi, then gets in. Driving: W/S throttle, A/D steer,
    Space up, Shift down.
  - taxis are solid: you bump into their sides, and you can land on a roof
    and ride along; a taxi left idle for 30 s flies back into traffic.
- **Arzach:**
  - a bone-white world of needle spires, stone arches, floating ruins and a
    lone tower;
  - **E** whistles for the bird. Flying: A/D bank, W dive to gain speed, S
    pull up, Space flap.
- **The Airtight Garage:** three zones joined by glowing portals. Each has its
  own gravity, and the ink style switches when you cross between them:
  - **Grubert's plateau:** normal gravity, Moebius style;
  - **the upside-down quarter:** a city hanging under a slab, where gravity
    pulls you up; Animated ink style;
  - **the ring:** a cylinder habitat lit through a slit in its roof, where
    gravity points outward so you walk all the way round; Sable style.
- **Edena:**
  - flat colours and thin lines, light stipple only;
  - giant umbrella trees (climb the trunk and stand on the canopy), step
    pyramids and white android ruins with glyphs.
- **Perdide:**
  - a twilight swamp with inked water;
  - crystal forests and egg clutches that glow;
  - carnivorous plants that snap when you get close;
  - a crystal cave lit from within;
  - wading into deep water puts you back on dry ground; **E** whistles for
    the hover-skiff.

**Climbing works everywhere:**
- push into a steep wall to grab it;
- W/S climb, A/D shuffle sideways, Shift climbs faster, Space jumps off;
- reaching the top pulls you up over the edge;
- stamina runs out after about 20 s on the wall.

**Gravity:**
- the player moves in a local frame (up, forward, right);
- the "forward" direction is carried along smoothly as "up" changes, so the
  controls and camera don't spin;
- the camera rolls with gravity.

## How the look is built

Three passes per frame (`src/main.js`):

1. **Shadow maps.** There are two orthographic cascades that follow the
   player and snap to texels, so shadows don't shimmer:
   - a sharp 4096² map covering ±220 m;
   - a 2048² map covering ±1150 m, so mesas shadow distant dunes. It
     refreshes every third frame.

   The comparison is done by hand in `materials.js`, and the two maps blend
   at their borders.
2. **G-buffer (MRT).** Every object uses one surface shader
   (`src/materials.js`). It does no stylisation. It only writes:
   - `RT0.rgb` = flat albedo. This is a plain colour, procedural sand
     patches with rock on slopes, or horizontal **strata bands** for mesas.
   - `RT0.a` = light term: half-lambert × cast shadow. Cast shadows are
     clamped just below the toon threshold, so the post pass can tell
     "in shadow" apart from "facing away".
   - `RT1` = world normal + linear view depth (0 means sky).
   - `RT2` = hatch strokes (single and cross), drawn on the surface itself.
     The strokes come from a triplanar projection of the object-space
     position, scaled by the object's scale. That way they stay attached to
     objects as the camera, or the object, moves.
   - Stroke spacing is measured from screen-space derivatives and snapped to
     powers of two. Each coarser level keeps every other line of the finer
     one, so when you walk away, lines fade out instead of sliding across
     the surface.
   - Faceted rocks get their normals from `dFdx/dFdy`, so they need no
     special geometry.
   - Each stroke is an isoline of a single stroke coordinate:
     - terrain uses a top-down projection, continuous across dune crests;
     - smooth objects blend the three triplanar projections at the
       coordinate level, so the stroke angle turns gradually instead of two
       patterns overlapping;
     - faceted objects use one projection per facet.
   - The same surface frame drives the **stipple** mode (Sable's
     "occasional dotting"): jittered dots whose size and count grow with
     darkness.
   - Architecture can draw object-space **grid lines** (Sable's "gridded
     lines").
   - The terrain gets **Sable-style sand blobs**: small irregular spots at
     three scales that give a sense of scale. They stay below the
     colour-edge threshold so they don't get outlined, and fade out before
     they shimmer.
3. **Moebius composite** (`src/post.js`). All the style lives in one
   full-screen shader:
   - **Ink lines** come from four signals:
     - depth discontinuities, using the Laplacian of *1/z*, which is
       exactly 0 on any plane, so there are no false lines on ground at
       grazing angles;
     - normal creases;
     - albedo boundaries, which outline strata and sand patches the way an
       inker outlines flat colour areas;
     - cast-shadow boundaries.
   - **Line style.** Lines get thinner with distance. The sample positions
     are offset by a noise field for a hand-inked wobble. "Line boil"
     re-rolls that noise at 8 fps.
   - **Two-tone cel shading.** Lit areas show the pure albedo. Shadowed
     areas show albedo × a lavender shadow tint, a very Moebius choice.
   - **Hatching** takes the surface-anchored strokes from `RT2`: pen strokes
     in the shade, and cross-hatching in the darkest areas. Hatching fades
     out with distance. The panel's "hatch anchoring" option switches back
     to the older screen-space strokes for comparison.
   - **Atmospheric perspective.** Fog blends towards the sky horizon colour,
     and lines and hatching fade with it, so distant mesas become pale flat
     silhouettes.
   - **Procedural sky** with a gradient, an inked sun disc with a halo ring,
     and flat inked clouds with hatched undersides.
   - **Paper.** Grain, fibre and a vignette.

## Regions, drawn details and wind

- **Regions** (`src/biome.js`): golden dunes, rose canyons and salt flats.
  A smooth field drives several things:
  - ground colours, in the shader;
  - terrain shape: flat salt pans, sharper canyon ridges;
  - where props cluster;
  - the fog density and horizon tint around the player.
- **Drawn details** are written into `RT2.b` as roughly 1 px ink lines. Each
  fades out before it gets dense enough to shimmer:
  - wind ripples on sand;
  - dried-mud cracks on the salt flats (Voronoi borders);
  - fissures on mesa faces;
  - grid lines and alien glyphs on standing stones.
- **Cloud shadows**: each ground point is projected along the light onto a
  drifting cloud layer about 300 m up. Its cover uses the same threshold as
  the sky's clouds, so shadows move with the wind and get the same two-tone
  shading and hatching as cast shadows.
- **Wind-blown sand** (`src/wind.js`): inked wisps that skim the ground in
  gusts, plus dust behind the bike. They are drawn after the composite pass,
  and each one tests itself against the G-buffer depth so it hides behind
  dunes and rocks.
- **Hoverbike** (`src/bike.js`): it rides on a hover spring, drifts a little,
  banks into turns and pitches with the ground. The camera swings behind it
  unless you're moving the mouse.

## Time of day

The `Time of day` folder drives sun and moon positions plus a palette
(sky, fog, light tint, shadow tint) keyed through dawn, day, dusk and night
(`src/timeofday.js`). At night the moon becomes the shadow-casting light,
as in Sable, and stars appear. The sun and moon are drawn separately. Around
the moment the light switches from one to the other, the shadow tone
converges to the light tone, so shadows fade out and back in instead of
jumping. "Hours / minute" runs the cycle. Character
poses update at 12 fps ("stop-motion anim") while movement stays smooth.

## Story, people, sound and weather

- **Story** (`src/quest.js`, `src/levels/content.js`):
  - each world has one quiet goal, marked by a beam of light, with its
    distance in the HUD;
  - a first visit opens a wordless three-panel comic page, rendered live
    from the game, and reaching the goal opens the closing page.
- **Relics:** five per world, often on rooftops, mesas or trees you have to
  climb. Picking one up sketches the moment into your **sketchbook**: press
  **J** to open it. Progress is saved in `localStorage`.
- **People** (`src/npc.js`):
  - two to five per world, wearing the same rider design in their own
    colours, with simulated cloaks near the camera;
  - they walk their routes, stop to look at you, wave, and say a line in a
    speech balloon; shy ones run away if you charge at them.
- **Travel:** every world has a stone gate. Walk through it and the page
  turns to the next world, where you step out of its gate (desert → city →
  Arzach → Garage → Edena → Perdide → desert).
- **Sound** (`src/audio.js`): everything is synthesised with Web Audio, with
  no audio files.
  - A generative score per world: its own scale, tempo, pads, bass and
    sparse arpeggios, with reverb.
  - Wind that follows the gusts and storms, and rain.
  - Footsteps that match the ground (sand, stone, grass) and the cloak
    flutter.
  - The jetpack roar, an engine for the bike, skiff and taxis, and bird
    flaps.
  - Chimes for relics, page turns, and a whoosh at the gates.
  - Sound starts on your first click, and **M** mutes.
- **Weather** (`src/weather.js`): each world alternates clear spells with
  its own weather, ramping in and out over a few seconds. You can force it
  from World → weather.
  - Sandstorms: a warm haze swallows the distance, and streaks of sand race
    across the screen.
  - Rain: slanted ink strokes falling over the scene.
  - Fog banks in the city-shaft and on Perdide.
  - Weather drives the wind on the cloak and the sound.
- **Loading:** the world is built in stages behind an animated inked loading
  screen, and every shader is compiled before the first frame, so there's no
  hitch when it appears.

## Beauty pass

Each of these can be toggled or tuned in the panel's **Beauty** folder.
- **Line weight like an inker:**
  - silhouettes are drawn about 1.6× heavier, while creases and colour
    boundaries are lighter;
  - a "pen pressure" noise swells and thins each line along its length.
- **Supersampled antialiasing:**
  - the whole pipeline renders at 1.5× or 2× and is box-filtered down;
  - stroke sizes follow, so the lines just get cleaner;
  - the default is 1× on Retina screens, which are already dense.
- **Hatching that follows form:** on slopes the strokes become height
  contours, and on smooth objects the cross-hatch wraps round them as rings.
- **Crease shading:**
  - small screen-space ambient occlusion from the depth and normal buffers;
  - it darkens building bases, crevices and canopy undersides, and adds ink
    accents where geometry closes in.
- **Skies:**
  - posterised gradient bands and sun rays at low sun;
  - per-level planets: toon-lit, cratered, hatched on the night side, with
    optional rings;
  - per-level colour scripts (`sky.script`): day, dusk and night palettes.
- **Layered haze:** distant terrain flattens into a few flat tones, like a
  printed background.
- **Shadows:** a third, very fine cascade (±12 m) around the player keeps the
  character's shadow crisp; it no longer crawls across coarse texels.
- **Local lights:** up to 8 glowing things near the player (crystals, eggs,
  portals, orbs, the jetpack flame) pool light on nearby surfaces, even in
  shadow.
- **Life** (`src/life.js`):
  - bird flocks with flapping wings;
  - drifting motes (dust, pollen, ash, blinking fireflies), drawn as
    depth-tested sprites so they don't turn into ink specks;
  - waving cloth banners;
  - acid steam rising in the city-shaft;
  - swaying flowers in Edena;
  - footprints in sand.
- **The character:** a real human body (Quaternius' Universal Base
  Characters, CC0) dressed as the Arzach rider: tunic, trousers, belt and
  boots, coloured by body region in a skinned version of the inked material.
  The red hood and a cloth cape go on top.
  - **Reshaped at load** (`reshape()` in `src/humanoid.js`) from the stock
    superhero into a gaunt Moebius figure:
    - every vertex is pulled toward the bones it's skinned to, weighted so
      the joints stay smooth;
    - the shoulders come in by moving the arm bones, then the mesh is
      re-bound;
    - the face gets narrower and longer, with a straighter nose, hollow
      cheeks and a firmer chin, and the brows are thinned.
  - **Face ink:** the shader draws fine lines in rest-pose face coordinates:
    the upper lids, light marks under the eyes, nose-to-mouth folds,
    cheekbones and the mouth.
  - **Motion:** mocap from Quaternius' Universal Animation Library (CC0).
    - Idle, walk, jog, sprint and jump clips play on a hidden copy of the
      library skeleton and are retargeted by limb direction onto our rig.
    - Locomotion blends by speed on one shared gait phase, with playback rate
      set from each clip's measured stride, so the feet don't skate.
    - Climbing, riding, gliding and jetpack keep their authored poses.
  - **The human skeleton** is aimed bone by bone along the rig every frame,
    keeping each bone's rest twist. The same body drives the NPCs, in male
    and female versions with varied skin tones.
  - **The cloak is real cloth** (`src/cape.js`): Verlet particles pinned at
    the collar.
    - Structural, shear and bend constraints keep its shape.
    - It feels gravity along the local "up" and drag from the air and wind,
      and it collides with the body and legs.
  - **Toggle:** "mocap animation" in the Time of day folder switches back to
    the procedural gait for comparison.
- **Hero landmarks:**
  - the desert: a colossal half-buried masked head;
  - Arzach: a fallen stone colossus and a giant hand rising from the plain;
  - the city-shaft: the Incal and its dark twin above the palace;
  - the Garage: a cathedral of turning gears and pistons;
  - Edena: Stel and Atan's crashed ship;
  - Perdide: the Great Crystal and its stone ring.
- **Softer forms:** towers and trunks get organic bulges and pinches
  (`soften()` in `src/world.js`).
- **Photo mode** (**P**):
  - WASD with Q/E flies a free camera; the mouse looks around, Shift goes
    faster;
  - H toggles the panel, and Enter saves a PNG.

## World

The terrain is a 4 km × 4 km heightfield with domain-warped ridged dunes and
a ring of mountains to close the horizon (`src/world.js`). Props are placed
procedurally:
- terraced, striped mesas
- mushroom rocks
- arches
- giant ribcage skeletons with tusks
- monolith rings with floating orbs
- floating islands
- a dome-and-spire city
- about 9k instanced boulders and desert plants

Collision uses simple circles against the props, plus an exact height
lookup on the terrain mesh.
