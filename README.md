# Moebius / Sable — three.js shader PoC

A small third-person desert exploration prototype. The point of it is the
rendering: a "ligne claire" look in the style of Moebius and the game *Sable*.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173
```

Controls: click to capture the mouse · WASD move · Shift run · Space jump ·
hold Space in the air to glide · mouse wheel zoom · Esc releases the mouse.
**E** whistles for the hoverbike, then mounts or dismounts it. On the bike:
W/S throttle and brake, A/D steer, Shift boost, Space hop.

## Collision

`src/physics.js` bakes every static mesh of the level into one world-space
geometry with a [three-mesh-bvh](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh)
BVH. Moving things, plants and the desert heightfield are flagged
`userData.noCollide`; the heightfield keeps its own exact lookup.
- **Characters:**
  - a downward ground ray lets you step onto anything lower than 0.6 m and
    stand on rocks, mesa tops, roofs and domes;
  - a capsule from step height to the head is pushed out of walls and
    ceilings, and you slide along walls.
- **Bike and taxis** use the same rays and capsules.
- **Camera:** a line-of-sight ray pulls it in front of walls, so it never
  clips inside buildings.
The panel on the right exposes every shader parameter. It also has style
presets (Moebius / Sable / Animated ink) and debug views of each G-buffer channel.

## Levels

Pick a level from the panel, or use the URL: `?level=desert` (the default)
or `?level=incal`.

- **Desert (Sable):** open dunes, mesas, three regions, a hoverbike and
  wind.
- **L'Incal: the city-shaft** (`src/levels/incal.js`). This is the pit-city
  from Jodorowsky & Moebius' *L'Incal*:
  - a 520 m-wide shaft dropping 580 m to an acid lake;
  - eight levels of terraces with towers: pastel at the top, rusty in the
    depths;
  - a striped central spire with rings, bridges and a golden palace on top;
  - floating landing pads, hanging cables, billboards with glyphs, flying
    taxis on circular lanes, and a skyline around the rim.

  The haze thickens and turns greener as you descend. Falling into the
  acid sends you back to the rim.

  **Jetpack:** hold Space in the air, or keep holding it after a jump, to
  thrust. You get about 5 s of fuel, which refills on the ground. When it
  runs out, holding Space glides.

  **Taxis** (`src/taxi.js`): press E to hail the nearest one. It flies over
  and waits beside you. Press E again to get in and fly it:
  - W/S throttle, A/D steer, Space up, Shift down;
  - E gets out, even mid-air (the jetpack takes over);
  - the taxi stays parked where you left it.

## How the look is built

Three passes per frame (`src/main.js`):

1. **Shadow maps.** There are two orthographic cascades that follow the
   player and snap to texels, so shadows don't shimmer:
   - a sharp 4096² map covering ±220 m;
   - a 2048² map covering ±1150 m, so mesas shadow distant dunes. It
     refreshes every third frame.

   The comparison is done by hand in `materials.js`, and the two maps blend
   at their borders.
2. **G-buffer (MRT).** Every object uses one surface shader
   (`src/materials.js`). It does no stylisation. It only writes:
   - `RT0.rgb` = flat albedo. This is a plain colour, procedural sand
     patches with rock on slopes, or horizontal **strata bands** for mesas.
   - `RT0.a` = light term: half-lambert × cast shadow. Cast shadows are
     clamped just below the toon threshold, so the post pass can tell
     "in shadow" apart from "facing away".
   - `RT1` = world normal + linear view depth (0 means sky).
   - `RT2` = hatch strokes (single and cross), drawn on the surface itself.
     The strokes come from a triplanar projection of the object-space
     position, scaled by the object's scale. That way they stay attached to
     objects as the camera, or the object, moves.
   - Stroke spacing is measured from screen-space derivatives and snapped to
     powers of two. Each coarser level keeps every other line of the finer
     one, so when you walk away, lines fade out instead of sliding across
     the surface.
   - Faceted rocks get their normals from `dFdx/dFdy`, so they need no
     special geometry.
   - Each stroke is an isoline of a single stroke coordinate:
     - terrain uses a top-down projection, continuous across dune crests;
     - smooth objects blend the three triplanar projections at the
       coordinate level, so the stroke angle turns gradually instead of two
       patterns overlapping;
     - faceted objects use one projection per facet.
   - The same surface frame drives the **stipple** mode (Sable's
     "occasional dotting"): jittered dots whose size and count grow with
     darkness.
   - Architecture can draw object-space **grid lines** (Sable's "gridded
     lines").
   - The terrain gets **Sable-style sand blobs**: small irregular spots at
     three scales that give a sense of scale. They stay below the
     colour-edge threshold so they don't get outlined, and fade out before
     they shimmer.
3. **Moebius composite** (`src/post.js`). All the style lives in one
   full-screen shader:
   - **Ink lines** come from four signals:
     - depth discontinuities, using the Laplacian of *1/z*, which is
       exactly 0 on any plane, so there are no false lines on ground at
       grazing angles;
     - normal creases;
     - albedo boundaries, which outline strata and sand patches the way an
       inker outlines flat colour areas;
     - cast-shadow boundaries.
   - **Line style.** Lines get thinner with distance. The sample positions
     are offset by a noise field for a hand-inked wobble. "Line boil"
     re-rolls that noise at 8 fps.
   - **Two-tone cel shading.** Lit areas show the pure albedo. Shadowed
     areas show albedo × a lavender shadow tint, a very Moebius choice.
   - **Hatching** takes the surface-anchored strokes from `RT2`: pen strokes
     in the shade, and cross-hatching in the darkest areas. Hatching fades
     out with distance. The panel's "hatch anchoring" option switches back
     to the older screen-space strokes for comparison.
   - **Atmospheric perspective.** Fog blends towards the sky horizon colour,
     and lines and hatching fade with it, so distant mesas become pale flat
     silhouettes.
   - **Procedural sky** with a gradient, an inked sun disc with a halo ring,
     and flat inked clouds with hatched undersides.
   - **Paper.** Grain, fibre and a vignette.

## Regions, drawn details and wind

- **Regions** (`src/biome.js`): golden dunes, rose canyons and salt flats.
  A smooth field drives several things:
  - ground colours, in the shader;
  - terrain shape: flat salt pans, sharper canyon ridges;
  - where props cluster;
  - the fog density and horizon tint around the player.
- **Drawn details** are written into `RT2.b` as roughly 1 px ink lines. Each
  fades out before it gets dense enough to shimmer:
  - wind ripples on sand;
  - dried-mud cracks on the salt flats (Voronoi borders);
  - fissures on mesa faces;
  - grid lines and alien glyphs on standing stones.
- **Cloud shadows**: each ground point is projected along the light onto a
  drifting cloud layer about 300 m up. Its cover uses the same threshold as
  the sky's clouds, so shadows move with the wind and get the same two-tone
  shading and hatching as cast shadows.
- **Wind-blown sand** (`src/wind.js`): inked wisps that skim the ground in
  gusts, plus dust behind the bike. They are drawn after the composite pass,
  and each one tests itself against the G-buffer depth so it hides behind
  dunes and rocks.
- **Hoverbike** (`src/bike.js`): it rides on a hover spring, drifts a little,
  banks into turns and pitches with the ground. The camera swings behind it
  unless you're moving the mouse.

## Time of day

The `Time of day` folder drives sun and moon positions plus a palette
(sky, fog, light tint, shadow tint) keyed through dawn, day, dusk and night
(`src/timeofday.js`). At night the moon becomes the shadow-casting light,
as in Sable, and stars appear. The sun and moon are drawn separately. Around
the moment the light switches from one to the other, the shadow tone
converges to the light tone, so shadows fade out and back in instead of
jumping. "Hours / minute" runs the cycle. Character
poses update at 12 fps ("stop-motion anim") while movement stays smooth.

## World

The terrain is a 4 km × 4 km heightfield with domain-warped ridged dunes and
a ring of mountains to close the horizon (`src/world.js`). Props are placed
procedurally:
- terraced, striped mesas
- mushroom rocks
- arches
- giant ribcage skeletons with tusks
- monolith rings with floating orbs
- floating islands
- a dome-and-spire city
- about 9k instanced boulders and desert plants

Collision uses simple circles against the props, plus an exact height
lookup on the terrain mesh.
